Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for Inverted Pendulum

### Introduction

The theory of optimal control is concerned with operating a dynamic system at minimum cost. The case where the system dynamics are described by a set of linear differential equations and the cost is described by a quadratic function is called the LQ problem. One of the main results in the theory is that the solution is provided by the linearâ€“quadratic regulator (LQR), a feedback controller... (Wikipedia)

LQR is one of the optimal control techniques making optimal control decisions using the current state of dynamical system. As a way of understanding LQR, wheeled inverted pendulum is used in modeling and simulation.

### Requirements

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-tk
$ sudo apt-get install python-scipy
$ sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

$ pip install slycot
$ pip install control
```
If you have some trouble installing `slycot` you may find useful informatio at [Slycot GitHub page](https://github.com/jgoppert/Slycot). There are alternatives to install the package. (I used `conda`.) Also, you can find more information about `python-control` at [Python Control Systems Library](http://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html).

### Run

```
$ python view/sim.py
```

### Demo
